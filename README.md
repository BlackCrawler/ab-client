# airmash-client
A hybrid nodejs and browser client for airmash.
It's in a very premature state. 

# building

- make sure you have the gulp-cli installed (npm i -g gulp-cli)
- npm i

to create a browser client:

- gulp browser

will result in dist/index.html with a *very* premature browser client

- gulp

will result in dist/app.js with a nodejs client that only logs chat messages.
